## Key Files in the ICA Report Project

Understanding the project's file structure is crucial for navigation and maintenance. This section outlines the most important files and directories, explaining their purpose and how they contribute to the overall report generation process.

### Core Quarto Documents

*   **`ICA_Report_Template.qmd`**: This is the **master template** for individual department reports. It contains the structure, narrative, and embedded R code chunks that generate the content (text, tables, figures) for each specific department's ICA report. It's designed to be parameterized, allowing the `render_department_report.R` script to feed it department-specific data.
*   **`ICA_All_Ministries_Report.qmd`**: This Quarto document is used to generate a **summary or aggregate report** across all ministries. It might pull data from all individual department reports or process a consolidated dataset to provide a high-level overview.

### R Scripts for Automation

*   **`render_department_report.R`**: This is the **primary automation script**. It orchestrates the entire report generation process. Its responsibilities include:
    *   Loading necessary R packages.
    *   Reading configuration or lists of departments/ministries.
    *   Iterating through each department.
    *   Preparing department-specific data.
    *   Calling `quarto render` on `ICA_Report_Template.qmd` for each department, passing the relevant parameters.
    *   Managing output file paths and names.

### Data Files

*   **`table_data.csv`**: This CSV file is the **raw or primary dataset** used for the ICA reports. It's the source from which all analyses and visualizations are derived. Its structure would typically include columns for department, ministry, various capacity indicators, and survey responses.
*   **`fig3_data_Department_of_Forestry.rds`**: Files with the `.rds` extension are **R Data Serialization** files. They store R objects (like data frames, lists, or models) in a binary format, allowing for efficient saving and loading of processed data. This specific file suggests that some pre-processed or aggregated data for the "Department of Forestry" (possibly for a specific figure, like Figure 3) is saved separately for quick access during report generation.

### Output and Asset Directories

*   **`Output/`**: This directory is a general-purpose output folder. It might contain **intermediate files, logs, or temporary outputs** generated during the R script execution or Quarto rendering process.
*   **`Reports/`**: This is the **final destination for all generated ICA reports**. It's structured hierarchically by ministry and then by department, containing the final PDF and/or HTML reports \n (e.g., `Reports/Ministry_of_Agriculture__Livestock__Forestry_and_Biosecurity/ICA_Report_Department_of_Forestry.pdf`).
*   **`img/`**: This directory stores **static image assets** used within the Quarto documents. These could be logos, explanatory diagrams (e.g., `Capacity-people-context-environment.png`), or other visual elements that are not generated dynamically by R code.
*   **`fonts/`**: Contains **custom font files** (e.g., `.ttf` files like `SourceSansPro-Regular.ttf`). These are included to ensure consistent typography and branding across all generated reports, especially for PDF outputs where specific fonts might be embedded.

### Configuration and Environment Files

*   **`.RData` and `.Rhistory`**: These are standard files generated by RStudio.
    *   `.RData` saves the R workspace (all objects in your environment) when RStudio closes.
    *   `.Rhistory` saves the command history.
    While useful for interactive R sessions, they are generally ignored in version control for reproducible projects.
*   **`.gitignore`**: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. It typically includes generated files (like `.RData`, `.pdf`, `.html` outputs) and temporary files.
*   **`_quarto.yml` (in `docs/`)**: This is the **configuration file for the Quarto website**. It defines the website's structure, navigation, theme, and other global settings.
*   **`styles.css` (in `docs/`)**: This CSS file provides **custom styling** for the Quarto website, allowing for branding and visual adjustments beyond the default Quarto themes.

This organized structure ensures that the project is maintainable, scalable, and that the automated report generation runs smoothly.
